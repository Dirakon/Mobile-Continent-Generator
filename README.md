# MobileContinentGenerator
Mobile version of my continent generator previously written in C++ using glut, now being written in Java (maybe Kotlin later) using Android Studio (my first project with that IDE).
First time working with github too. Don't know if I ever gonna do project with someone other than me, but I still want to make my code public, I think it will be funnier for everyone that way. I don't think that anyone gonna read my code is the other problem, but it's not the problem I can fix, so whatever.
